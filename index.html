    <p>Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.</p>
    <p>Console collects log messages that are generated from your computer and connected devices, and you can use these messages to check on your computer's performance and solve problems.</p>
